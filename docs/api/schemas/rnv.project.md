# rnv.project Schema Definition

The schema defines the following properties:

## `workspaceID` (string)

Workspace ID your project belongs to. This will mach same folder name in the root of your user directory. ie `~/` on macOS

## `projectVersion` (string)

Version of project

## `projectName` (string)

Name of the project which will be used in workspace as folder name. this will also be used as part of the KEY in crypto env var generator

Properties of the `defaults` object:

### `ports` (object)

The object is an array with all elements of the type `string`.

### `portOffset` (number)

## `crypto` (object)

This prop enables automatic encrypt and decrypt of sensitive information in your project. 
RNV will generate new env variable with can be used to encrypt and decrypt. this env var is generated by combining (and sanitizing) 2 properties from your renative.json: 
workspaceID + projectName.
These 2 properties are also used to generate path on your local machine where encrypted files will be decrypted into.
